# Portfolio

# The task
The task was to create a portfolio according to a design provided by Technigo. The task was to follow the design strictly but we were allowed to change the colors and pictures. 

# The problem
I decided to use flexbox for the project. I had som trouble in the beginning with sidescrolling but Daniels helped with a piece of code that fixed that problem. I divided the webpage into the sections that were in the design and changed the background colors of them, that way I could always keep track of where I was in the site. It also helped when I accidentaly deleted an end-tag because then the background color would change. 

Sometimes it was hard using flexbox and the content did not want to end up where I wanted. To solve this I read up on flex-box commands and tried several times and eventually it worked. I had som trouble with the buttons. I first had the buttons nested inside an anchor tag but that was bad for accessibility, I eventually asked in the code help channel and got a tip of using form instead and that worked. It was a time-consuming but fun project!
